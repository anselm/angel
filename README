HOW TO INSTALL
===============

Also see the /about page on the site for other details that may be relevant.

1) You will need postgres and postgis.  These are used for spatial queries and for full text search as well as ordinary database storage. It is unlikely you'll get this running on mysql easily.

Make a spatially enabled database like so:

   createuser -p  # name angel password angel
   createdb -O angel angel
   createlang plpgsql angel
   psql -d angel -f /usr/local/share/postgis/lwpostgis.sql
   psql -d angel -f /usr/local/share/postgis/spatial_ref_sys.sql
   # see : http://mappinghacks.com/data/
   # wget http://mappinghacks.com/data/world_boundaries.zip
   psql angel < world_boundaries.sql 

2) There are a pile of gems that are required:

   gem install GeoRuby # used by: script/plugin install git://github.com/fragility/spatial_adapter.git
   gem install sanitize
   gem install tsearch2
   gem install json-pure
   gem install ...

3) There is a settings.yml file that has pile of third party requirements such as keys from metacarta.

4) There is some test data to seed the database - you can load it like this:

  rake db:migrate:redo
  rake db:seed

5) I like to use passenger phusion - it is optiona.

6) type "script/server start" to run the application.  it will appear on port 80 and you can use a web browser to see it.
