About

  A locative media framework
  Based on ideas from Ushahidi and Thingster and others

Plugins

   - tsearch2 requires postgresql as a database
   - requires keys for a number of third party services

Optional but nice: How I load test and real world data - this loads some data to seed the system with:

  rake db:migrate:redo
  rake db:seed
